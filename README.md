      <ul>
        <li><p>born February 17 , 1975 in New York State.</p></li>
        <li><p>His childhood was particularly difficult. At the age of 6, in addition to school, he began working nights in his father's ice rink located in the heart of the Masten District. This night work will result in creating gaps in his education that will take him a long time to make up for. </p></li>
        <li><p> David is also exposed to significant physical and psychological violence from Trunnis Goggins, who regularly beats his mother and who does not hesitate to terrorize her two sons so that they do not talk about what is happening at home. This will in particular cause post-traumatic stress disorders in David.</p></li>
        <li><p>In 1986, his mother met Wilmoth Irving who would play the role of a true “father figure” for David and who would little by little help him combat his post-traumatic stress and allow him to “find his place” in Brazil .where he is the only child of color. Later, Wilmoth would become David's father-in-law. </p></li>
        <li><p>But while Jackie and David had to move to Indianapolis with him, the latter was murdered in front of his home in 1989. David found himself face to face with the body of his late father-in-law, which caused him to plunge back into his psychological disorders 1 .</p></li>
        <li><p>It was only later that his interest in the army developed, notably through contact with his grandfather who was in the air force for 37 years. Then aged 19, he tried to join the latter by participating in the PJOC ( Pararescue Jump Orientation Course ), where he twice failed his ASVAB ( Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test ) necessary to be able to enter all the corps of the army American, mainly because of his educational shortcomings. It was during his third attempt that he managed to obtain this diploma and joined the Air Force 1 .</p></li>
        <li><p>David Goggins joined the Air Force with dreams of being part of a pararescue unit and initially applied to join the United States Air Force Pararescue. It should be noted that during training he was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia and he will be removed from training. Although he had the opportunity to resume training, he chose not to do so and was redirected to work as a rodent exterminator 1 .</p></li>
        <li><p>He is a former member of the Navy SEAL team 5 and he is the only member of the American armed forces to have followed and passed the training of Navy SEAL , U.S. Army Ranger School , and Air Force Tactical Air Controller Training</p></li>
        <li><p>He is also a top athlete in several disciplines. Notably, he has participated in more than 60 ultra-marathons , triathlons and ultra-triathlons , setting new records regularly. He also announced during an interview on the powerfulJRE YouTube channel that he would never have achieved his sporting exploits without his Perceval cap, and that this lucky object meant more to him than his own mother.</p></li>
        <li><p>He also holds the world record for overhand pull-ups completed in 17 hours and is considered "The fittest Man in America"​​by Outside magazine .</p></li>

     <h3 class="book-part">David Goggings wrote two books</h3>
    <div class="first-book">
        <div class="text"><p>What an inspiring book!  David Goggins proclaims, “life is unfair and the sooner you accept the sooner you can prepare for it.  The best way to approach life is with a “Can’t Hurt Me” mentality”.  David was viewed as an ultimate underdog and a weak man.  And to survive, he set out to build his own bulletproof mindset.  He wasn’t looking for fame, financial success, or a pat on the back.  He was looking for fulfillment and to connect with his life’s purpose.  And the only way he found it was within himself -by going to war with himself.Goggins states, “in today’s society, you are in danger of living a life that is so soft and comfortable that you will never realize your true potential”.  “Can’t Hurt Me” is David Goggins ethos to push your mental boundaries and help you realize your true potential.  Here is a brief summary of his “Can’t Hurt Me” mentality.</p></div>

    <div class="second-book">
        <div class="text"><p>Never Finished is a memoir by David Goggins, a retired Navy SEAL and ultra-endurance athlete. In the book, Goggins shares his story of overcoming adversity and achieving incredible things. He argues that we are all capable of achieving great things, but we need to first unshackle our minds and win the war within.David Goggins, one of the world’s best ultra-endurance athletes, asserts that most people can’t achieve their dreams because they don’t work hard enough. Goggins goes into great detail about the races he participated in and the injuries that he endured on his path to success. He had to overcome his own tendency to give up, which stemmed from hardship, abuse, and discrimination in his early life. Goggins believes that in order to become the best version of yourself, you must be prepared to constantly make an effort, learn, and adapt.
